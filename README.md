The site is live on http://react-my-blog.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

This is my first project of building a Blog application using AWS:
  - Used S3 bucket to host the site
  - Dynamo DB for storing the data
  - API Gateway services for API endpoints
  
Features:
  - View all the blogs from DynamoDB databse.
  - Login and Register User using Firebase Authentication
  - Upvote the blog
  - Add comment to the blog
